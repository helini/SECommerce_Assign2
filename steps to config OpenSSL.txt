Steps to config XAMPP to use PHP and OpenSSL
--------------------------------------------

Apache server configuration
...........................

PHP in XAMPP works with the inbuild Apache server. Therefore, when enabling SSL first check whether Apache is enabled.

Open the file xampp/apache/conf/httpd.conf in an editor and search for the line:
#LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

If this line has a "#" sign in front (commented), remove it to uncomment the line.
Then save and restart the server (I usually do it using system Services list). The webserver will then start with xampp's default ssl configuation.


XAMPP PHP configuration
.......................

OpenSSL extention ships with xampp installation, as a dll. We must tell php to load this dll file, in the "php.ini".

For that, open the file xampp/php/php.ini file in a text editor.
Locate the line,
;extension=php_openssl.dll

If it has ";" mark in the beginning remove it to uncomment the line.
Then save and restart the server (apache).

Note: You can use the below command to see the path of php.ini file the xampp installation works.
echo 'ini: ', get_cfg_var('cfg_file_path');


Setting php path, in Windows system
...................................

The 'php_openssl.dll' library is dependent on two other libraries that are also shiped with the XAMPP package. They are, "libeay32.dll" and "ssleay32.dll".

In order to use the OpenSSL library, these two libraries should be in the windows system path. For me, adding these libraries to Windows/System32 folder did not work. It only worked after I add the path to the xampp php folder, in to the PATH environment variable.

Therefore, get the path to the folder where these two libraries exist (by default: c:/xampp/php).
Then append it to the PATH environment variable. Make sure you do not point to any other php installation folders in the PATH.

Save environment variables.



Setting the openssl.cnf path in system variables
.................................................

In order to use OpenSSL functions you need a valid openssl.cnf file installed.
For that,
locate the openssl.cnf file in xampp/php/extras/openssl directory (this path is for PHP 5.x or later versions. For 4.x it is just php/openssl)

Create a new environment variable named "OPENSSL_CONF".
Add the path to the openssl.cnf file with the file name, as the value of the environment variable.

Save variables.

After doing these steps, I restarted the machine. Then it worked fine. :)
